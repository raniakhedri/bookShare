I've successfully integrated the marketplace functionality into your existing BookShare template structure, working on **port 8081** as requested.

## 🎯 **What's Integrated:**

### **Frontend (Frontoffice)**

  - Statistics dashboard (Total books, User books, Recent books)
  - Browse books functionality
  - Book sharing/exchange system
  - Integration with your existing navbar

### **Backend (Backoffice/Admin)**
- **Route**: `/admin/marketplace` - Already exists in your sidebar
- **Template**: `resources/views/backoffice/marketplace.blade.php` - New admin view
- **Features**:
  - Statistics overview (Total books, Available books, Requests, etc.)
  - Market books table with status display
