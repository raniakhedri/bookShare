# Icon Generator Script
# This is a placeholder - you'll need to convert the SVG to PNG manually or use an online tool

# You can use one of these methods to create the PNG icons:

# Method 1: Online converter
# 1. Go to https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png
# 2. Upload icons/icon128.svg
# 3. Convert to PNG at 128x128, 48x48, and 16x16 sizes
# 4. Download and save as icon128.png, icon48.png, icon16.png

# Method 2: Using Inkscape (if installed)
# inkscape icon128.svg -w 128 -h 128 -o icon128.png
# inkscape icon128.svg -w 48 -h 48 -o icon48.png
# inkscape icon128.svg -w 16 -h 16 -o icon16.png

# Method 3: Using ImageMagick (if installed)
# convert -background none -size 128x128 icon128.svg icon128.png
# convert -background none -size 48x48 icon128.svg icon48.png
# convert -background none -size 16x16 icon128.svg icon16.png

# Method 4: Using Node.js sharp library
# npm install sharp
# node convert-icons.js

# Temporary: Create simple colored squares as placeholders
# You should replace these with proper icons
